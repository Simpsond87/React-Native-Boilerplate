## Introduction

The React-Native Boilerplate is intended to help developers build Native Android and iOS quicker and easier,  

Since the init application for React-Native CLI is weak, I've decided to make my own boilerplate for building React-Native apps. This Boilerplate allows you to get right into building your app in a ReactJS component-based way, but also gives you control over the Android and iOS folders as well.

## Requirements
#### Android:
  * Android SDK Manager
  * SDK Tools >= 25
  * SDK Platform Tools >= 26
  * SDK Build Tools >= 26
  * Android 8.0.0 (API 26)
  * Google Play Services

#### iOS:
  * XCode
  * iOS >= 10.x

#### Both:
  * NodeJS >= 7.9.0
  * NPM >= 4.4.4
  * React-Native-Cli >= 2.0.1
  * React-Native >= 0.49.0
