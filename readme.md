## Introduction

The React-Native Boilerplate is intended to help developers build Native Android and iOS quicker and easier,  

Since the init application for React-Native CLI is weak, I've decided to make my own boilerplate for building React-Native apps. This Boilerplate allows you to get right into building your app in a ReactJS component-based way, but also gives you control over the Android and iOS folders as well.

## Requirements
#### Android:
  * Android SDK Manager
  * SDK Tools >= 25
  * SDK Platform Tools >= 26
  * SDK Build Tools >= 26
  * Android 8.0.0 (API 26)
  * Google Play Services

#### iOS:
  * XCode
  * iOS >= 10.x

#### Both:
  * NodeJS >= 7.9.0
  * NPM >= 4.4.4
  * React-Native-Cli >= 2.0.1
  * React-Native >= 0.49.0

## Getting Started
You can start by forking or cloning this repo, then running `npm install`, which will install all of the necessary libraries for you to begin coding.
In order to run your application in development mode, you will need two terminals open. In the first terminal, you will start the packager with `react-native start --reset-cache` and in the second terminal, you will run your application with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.
